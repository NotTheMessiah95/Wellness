# Wellness
A simple wellness tracker in Java for a personal project.

Currently implemented:

Menu system. Prompts user to select a 'module', which ask the user a question. User gives their rating, then basic feedback is offered.

Current feature plans:

Must-Have:

- [x] Ask user a series of questions

- [x] User input for answers

- [] Store users answers in a text file


Should Have:

- [x] Menu system so users can select their category

- [] Structured storage for user answers- maybe a JSON for example?

- [] Store data per-day (e.g. use a date format rather than just a number for each 'entry')


Could have:

- [] Feedback on daily changes (i.e improvements in response for a category)

- [] Simple graphs/charts

- [] Keep comments/short notes in a days entry


Won't have:

GUI

Database connection (probably a bit too extreme at the moment to learn SQL as well!)
