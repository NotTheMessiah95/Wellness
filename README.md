# Wellness
A simple wellness tracker in Java for a personal project.

Current feature plans:
Must-Have:
Ask user a series of questions
User input for answers
Store users answers in a text file

Should Have:
Menu system so users can select their category
Structured storage for user answers- maybe a JSON for example?
Store data per-day (e.g. use a date format rather than just a number for each 'entry')

Could have:
Feedback on daily changes (i.e improvements in response for a category)
Simple graphs/charts
Keep comments/short notes in a days entry

Won't have:
GUI
Database connection (probably a bit too extreme at the moment to learn SQL as well!)
